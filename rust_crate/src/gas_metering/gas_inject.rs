/// Transforms a given module into one that tracks the gas charged during its execution.
///
/// The output module uses the `gas` function to track the gas spent. The function could be either
/// an imported or a local one modifying a mutable global. The argument is the amount of gas
/// required to continue execution. The execution engine is meant to keep track of the total amount
/// of gas used and trap or otherwise halt execution of the runtime if the gas usage exceeds some
/// allowed limit.
///
/// The body of each function of the original module is divided into metered blocks, and the calls
/// to charge gas are inserted at the beginning of every such block of code. A metered block is
/// defined so that, unless there is a trap, either all of the instructions are executed or none
/// are. These are similar to basic blocks in a control flow graph, except that in some cases
/// multiple basic blocks can be merged into a single metered block. This is the case if any path
/// through the control flow graph containing one basic block also contains another.
///
/// Charging gas at the beginning of each metered block ensures that 1) all instructions
/// executed are already paid for, 2) instructions that will not be executed are not charged for
/// unless execution traps, and 3) the number of calls to `gas` is minimized. The corollary is
/// that modules instrumented with this metering code may charge gas for instructions not
/// executed in the event of a trap.
///
/// Additionally, each `memory.grow` instruction found in the module is instrumented to first
/// make a call to charge gas for the additional pages requested. This cannot be done as part of
/// the block level gas charges as the gas cost is not static and depends on the stack argument
/// to `memory.grow`.
///
/// The above transformations are performed for every function body defined in the module. This
/// function also rewrites all function indices references by code, table elements, etc., since
/// the addition of an imported functions changes the indices of module-defined functions. If
/// the module has a `NameSection`, added by calling `parse_names`, the indices will also be
/// updated.
///
/// Syncronizing the amount of gas charged with the execution engine can be done in two ways. The
/// first way is by calling the imported `gas` host function, see [`host_function`] for details. The
/// second way is by using a local `gas` function together with a mutable global, see
/// [`mutable_global`] for details.
///
/// This routine runs in time linear in the size of the input module.
///
/// The function fails if the module contains any operation forbidden by gas rule set, returning
/// the original module as an `Err`.
